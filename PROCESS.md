# Day 1 (09/01/2018)
Updated the third visualization which includes income and housing prices of a number of large Dutch cities.
Potentially interesting to also include a small city/village average habitants income and housing price.

# Day 2 (10/01/2018)
Create page on website with explanation of data + source
Changed line chart 3 for a bar chart with average loan growth and rent growth for 5 cities over the past 3 years.

# Day 3 (11/01/2018)
Added map of Amsterdam with deelgemeenten.
Changed idea of visualization 3 from line chart to bar chart

# Day 4 (13/01/2018)
Added legenda and colors

# Day 5 (14/01/2018)
Added homepage, scroll down buttton, links, and improved reading of data

# Day 6 (15/01/2018)
Tried to add tooltip to map

# Day 7 (16/01/2018)
Finally have a tooltip showing the "name" of the "deelgemeente"for the map. The code was partly d3 version 3 and therefore not working

# Day 8 (17/01/2018)
Had a lot of trouble with loading the data in the tooltip. Problem was that one of the datasets used an extra space in the "deelgemeentes" name.
