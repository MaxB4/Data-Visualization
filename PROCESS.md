# Day 1 (09/01/2018)
Updated the third visualization which includes income and housing prices of a number of large Dutch cities.
Potentially interesting to also include a small city/village average habitants income and housing price.

# Day 2 (10/01/2018)
Create page on website with explanation of data + source
Changed line chart 3 for a bar chart with average loan growth and rent growth for 5 cities over the past 3 years.

# Day 3 (11/01/2018)
Added map of Amsterdam with deelgemeenten.
Changed idea of visualization 3 from line chart to bar chart

# Day 4 (13/01/2018)
Added legenda and colors

# Day 5 (14/01/2018)
Added homepage, scroll down buttton, links, and improved reading of data

# Day 6 (15/01/2018)
Tried to add tooltip to map

# Day 7 (16/01/2018)
Finally have a tooltip showing the "name" of the "deelgemeente"for the map. The code was partly d3 version 3 and therefore not working

# Day 8 (17/01/2018)
Had a lot of trouble with loading the data in the tooltip. Problem was that one of the datasets used an extra space in the "deelgemeentes" name. Will add a transition to the line chart. Bug: Deelgemeente Nieuw-West name is not loading

# Day 9 (18/01/2018)
Finalized tooltip, created second line. Failed to add tooltip to second line. No idea why.

# Day 10 (21/01/2018)
Started building a dropdown menu for the line chart.

# Day 11 (22/01/2018)
Finished dropdown menu and thinking about adding a rent and income button. Third visualization is going to be a pie chart with radio buttons. Pie chart shows percentage of "sociale huurwoning" per "deelgemeente".

# Day 11 (23/01/2018)
Created first version of pie chart with radio buttons. Had a lot of trouble with the colors because a couple of elements were above eachother.

# Day 12 (25/01/2018)
Goals for the day: fix favicon, deelgemeente nieuw_west, deleting data, and legend. Fixed favicon error message, added legend for pie chart and improved positioning of charts. Tried to add update function instead of deleting charts when new data is added but didnt succeed.

# Day 13 (28/01/2018)
Goals for the day: make line clickable, add titles, fix dropdown menu, and add no data (grey) to legend.
Line is now clickable, titles were added, fixed dropdown menu.
