# Data-Visualization
Final Project Minor Programmeren UvA

Average income and rent price in the municipalities of Amsterdam over the past 50(+/-) years.
Problem statement: The Amsterdam housing market is known to have a high demand and low offer of houses. In the past years the house prices have increased rapidly. The question rises if such a growth of house prices is sustainable on the long run and what the consequence of this has been in the past.
The target group of the visualization are people that live in Amsterdam or would like to live in Amsterdam.
