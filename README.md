# Data-Visualization
Final Project Minor Programmeren UvA

## Problem statement: 
The Amsterdam housing market is known to have a high demand for houses. In the past years the house prices have risen rapidly. The question rises if such a growth of house prices is sustainable on the long run and what the consequences of a faster growth rate of housing prices than income will have. Therefore, data will be visualized on these two variables to give insights in potential future scenarios of the Amsterdam housing market.

## solution
Data that will be used are the average income and house prices in the municipalities of Amsterdam over the past 50(+/-) years.
The target group of the visualization are people that live in Amsterdam or would like to live in Amsterdam.
The visualization will consist of an interactive map of Amsterdam and a line chart. The line chart will also give the option to compare municipalities average income and housing prices.
