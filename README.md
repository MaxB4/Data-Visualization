## Purpose
Data will be visualized for the submunicipalities of Amsterdam on rent prices, social versus private rent, and income versus rent prices between 2012 and 2015 to provide insights in the Amsterdam housing market and to find out if a difference is developing in income and housing prices.

The map shows the average income for each submunicapality in 2015. The scond visalization is a pie chart with a dropdown menu. The pie chart shows the percentage social rent versus normal rent in each submunicipality. All visualizations track the last clicked submunicipality in dropdown or in map.
